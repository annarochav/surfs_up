Challenge Week9 Data Analysis BootCamp using SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Flask.

## ⚡Overview of the analysis:

In this project, we analyzed the weather trends in Oahu, Hawaii so an investor can be sure to invest in a Surf and Ice Cream shop. The weather conditions can impact the sales so it’s very important to know the statistics, specifically for the months of June and December to determine if the shop is sustainable year-round. To analyze Oahu's weather data, SQLAlchemy was used to query the SQLite database.

## ⚡Results: 

 + If we look at the precipitation plot for a one-year timeframe, we can see that Oahu is mostly sunny throughout the day and experienced low rainfall (avg 0.1772) which are good news for the business.

 + Also, if we compare specifically June vs December, we can see that the average temperature in June is 3.9 degrees higher than December. 
 + The maximum temperatures are 85 degrees in June and 83 degrees in December which are remarkable similar.
 + The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and 56 in December, these results show that December could get chilly, and they should expect lower sales in this time of the year.

## ⚡Summary: 

We can conclude that both June and December have similar min/max and average temperatures and the investor can expect low precipitations. The temperature data is not strongly skewed for either month and there are few outliers. The data supports that Oahu is a great place to invest in a surf-and-ice cream shop and will have a pleasant weather almost all year long.
